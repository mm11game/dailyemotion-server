# hreq

A minimal http request client.

## Install

	npm install hreq

### Usage

The module returns a single function:

	hreq = require( "hreq" )

It takes an options argument which with the same format
as described for the built in Node.js https.request() function.
In addition, it takes a two callback functions, the first
will be called on success with the body of the response, and
the second will be called with an error if there was a problem:

	hreq( options[, callback_success[, callback_failure ] )

An attribute called "url" is expected to be in the options object:

	options = { url: "https://google.com" }

The url is passed as the first argument to https.request() and
the full options object is passed as the second argument.

	hreq( options, html => {
		console.log( "Google HTML is: " + html );
	}, err => {
		console.error( err );
	});
